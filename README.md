# DSA Course
This repo contains all the questions which I found important in the striver DSA course [link](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)

---

The structure of the repo is as follows
1. An appendix section contains some useful links for certain concepts
2. A H2 heading will contain the broad topic, for example - Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.
3. Each topic will have sub-headings. Each sub-heading will mean a different level for the question of that topic.
4. There will be a list of questions of each category level. It will contain the different links for that question, including videos, questions, articles, different solutions, etc.

## Appendix
Links of important concepts 
* **C++ STL Basics**
  * [Striver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRVYpIET_RU)
  * [Luv Babbar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgMPrLX-zsA)
    
* **Custom Sort** : If you want to swap, return `false`
  * [Luv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pvZhwp0U9w)
  * Most common method is to return the actual order you want. For example to sort an array in decreasing order `return num1 > num2;`
    
* **Lambda Functions** : Basic syntax
  ```cpp
  [ capture clause ] (parameters) -> return-type  
  {   
     definition of method   
  } 
  ```
  * Can ignore capture clause and return-type in most cases
  * Most common usage (sorts the vector in given order)
    ```cpp
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), [](int a, int b) -> {
    		return a > b;
    }
    ```
