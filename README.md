# DSA Course
This repo contains all the questions which I found important in the striver DSA course [link](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)

---

The structure of the repo is as follows
1. An appendix section contains some useful links for certain concepts
2. A H2 heading will contain the broad topic, for example - Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.
3. Each topic will have sub-headings. Each sub-heading will mean a different level for the question of that topic.
4. There will be a list of questions of each category level. It will contain the different links for that question, including videos, questions, articles, different solutions, etc.
